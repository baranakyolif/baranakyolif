- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @baranakyolif
- ðŸ‘€ My years of work in cyber anthropology, focusing on human-machine interaction data, have presented me with a significant opportunity in the era of emerging artificial intelligence technologies. With the growing importance of data processing and analytical processes today, I decided to integrate anthropological methods and methodologies into this field to provide a different context to data. Thus, I founded a company called "What If the Mind." This initiative focuses on projects related to clean energy, sustainable agriculture, decentralized technologies, and social areas, aligning with the mission of Industry 4.0.
